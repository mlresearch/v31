title: Bayesian learning of joint distributions of objects
section: notable
note: Notable paper award
abstract: There is increasing interest in broad application areas in defining flexible
  joint models for data having a variety of measurement scales, while also allowing
  data of complex types, such as functions, images and documents. We consider a general
  framework for nonparametric Bayes joint modeling through mixture models that incorporate
  dependence across data types through a joint mixing measure.  The mixing measure
  is assigned a novel infinite tensor factorization (ITF) prior that allows flexible
  dependence in cluster allocation across data types.  The ITF prior is formulated
  as a tensor product of stick-breaking processes.  Focusing on a convenient special
  case corresponding to a Parafac factorization, we provide basic theory justifying
  the flexibility of the proposed prior.  Focusing on ITF mixtures of product kernels,
  we develop a  new Gibbs sampling algorithm for routine implementation relying on
  slice sampling. The methods are compared with alternative joint mixture models based
  on Dirichlet processes and related approaches through simulations and real data
  applications.
