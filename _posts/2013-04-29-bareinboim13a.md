title: 'Meta-Transportability of Causal Effects: A Formal Approach'
abstract: 'This paper considers the problem of transferring experimental findings
  learned from multiple heterogeneous  domains to a different environment, in which
  only passive observations can be collected. Pearl and Bareinboim (2011) established
  a complete characterization for such transfer between two domains, a source and
  a target, and this paper generalizes their results to multiple heterogeneous domains.  It
  establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding when  effects in the
  target domain are estimable from both statistical and causal information transferred
  from the experiments in the source domains. The paper further provides a complete
  algorithm for computing the transport formula, that is, a way of fusing observational
  and experimental information to synthesize an unbiased estimate of the desired effects. '
