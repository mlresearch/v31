title: Permutation estimation and minimax rates of identifiability
section: notable
note: Notable paper award
abstract: The problem of matching two sets of features appears in various tasks of
  computer vision and can be often formalized as a problem of permutation estimation.
  We address this problem from a statistical point of view and provide a theoretical
  analysis of the accuracy of several natural estimators. To this end, the notion
  of the minimax matching threshold is introduced and its expression is obtained as
  a function of the sample size, noise level and dimensionality. We consider the cases
  of homoscedastic and heteroscedastic noise and carry out, in each case, upper bounds
  on the matching threshold of several estimators. This upper bounds are shown to
  be unimprovable in the homoscedastic setting. We also discuss the computational
  aspects of the estimators and provide some empirical evidence of their consistency
  on synthetic data-sets.
