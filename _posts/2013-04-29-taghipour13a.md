title: Completeness Results for Lifted Variable Elimination
abstract: Lifting aims at improving the efficiency of probabilistic inference by exploiting
  symmetries in the model. Various methods for lifted probabilistic inference have
  been proposed, but our understanding of these methods and the relationships between
  them is still limited, compared to their propositional counterparts. The only existing
  theoretical characterization of lifting is a completeness result for weighted first-order
  model counting. This paper addresses the question whether the same completeness
  result holds for other lifted inference algorithms. We answer this question positively
  for lifted variable elimination (LVE). Our proof relies on introducing a novel inference
  operator for LVE.
