title: Nystrom Approximation for Large-Scale Determinantal Processes
abstract: Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are appealing models for subset selection
  problems where diversity is desired.  They offer surprisingly efficient inference,
  including sampling in O(N^3) time and O(N^2) space, where N is the number of base
  items.  However, in some applications, N may grow so large that sampling from a
  DPP becomes computationally infeasible. This is especially true in settings where
  the DPP kernel matrix cannot be represented by a linear decomposition of low-dimensional
  feature vectors. In these cases, we propose applying the Nystrom approximation to
  project the kernel matrix into a low-dimensional space. While theoretical guarantees
  for the Nystrom approximation in terms of standard matrix norms have been previously
  established, we are concerned with probabilistic measures, like total variation
  distance between the DPP generated by a kernel matrix and the one generated by its
  Nystrom approximation, that behave quite differently. In this paper we derive new
  error bounds for the Nystrom-approximated DPP and present empirical results to corroborate
  them. We then demonstrate the Nystrom-approximated DPP by applying it to a motion
  capture summarization task.
