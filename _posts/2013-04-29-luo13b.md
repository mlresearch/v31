title: Fast Near-GRID Gaussian Process Regression
abstract: "\\emphGaussian process regression (GPR) is a powerful non-linear technique
  for Bayesian inference and prediction. One drawback is its O(N^3) computational
  complexity for both prediction and hyperparameter estimation for N input points
  which has led to much work in sparse GPR methods. In case that the covariance function
  is expressible as a \\emphtensor product kernel (TPK) and the inputs form a multidimensional
  grid, it was shown that the costs for exact GPR can be reduced to a sub-quadratic
  function of N. We extend these exact fast algorithms to sparse GPR and remark on
  a connection to \\emphGaussian process latent variable models (GPLVMs). In practice,
  the inputs may also violate the multidimensional grid constraints so we pose and
  efficiently solve missing and extra data problems for both exact and sparse grid
  GPR. We demonstrate our method on synthetic, text scan, and magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) data reconstructions."
