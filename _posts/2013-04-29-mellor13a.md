title: Thompson Sampling in Switching Environments with Bayesian Online Change Detection
abstract: 'Thompson Sampling has recently been shown to achieve the lower bound on
  regret in the Bernoulli Multi-Armed Bandit setting. This bandit problem assumes
  stationary distributions for the rewards. It is often unrealistic to model the real
  world as a stationary distribution. In this paper we derive and evaluate algorithms
  using Thompson Sampling for a Switching Multi-Armed Bandit Problem. We propose a
  Thompson Sampling strategy equipped with a Bayesian change point mechanism to tackle
  this problem. We develop algorithms for a variety of cases with constant switching
  rate: when switching occurs all arms change (Global Switching), switching occurs
  independently for each arm (Per-Arm Switching), when the switching rate is known
  and when it must be inferred from data. This leads to a family of algorithms we
  collectively term Change-Point Thompson Sampling (CTS).  We show empirical results
  in 4 artificial environments, and 2 derived from real world data: news click-through
  and foreign exchange data, comparing them to some other bandit algorithms. In real
  world data CTS is the most effective.  '
