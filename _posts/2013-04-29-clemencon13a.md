title: 'Scoring anomalies: a M-estimation formulation'
abstract: It is the purpose of this paper to formulate the issue of scoring multivariate
  observations depending on their degree of abnormality/novelty as an unsupervised
  learning task. Whereas in the 1-d situation, this problem can be dealt with by means
  of tail estimation techniques, observations being viewed as all the more “abnormal”
  as they are located far in the tail(s) of the underlying probability distribution.
  In a wide variety of applications, it is desirable to dispose of a scalar valued
  “scoring” function allowing for comparing the degree of abnormality of multivariate
  observations. Here we formulate the issue of scoring anomalies as a M-estimation
  problem. A (functional) performance criterion is proposed, whose optimal elements
  are, as expected, nondecreasing transforms of the density. The question of empirical
  estimation of this criterion is tackled and preliminary statistical results related
  to the accuracy of partition-based techniques for optimizing empirical estimates
  of the empirical performance measure are established.
