title: A Competitive Test for Uniformity of Monotone Distributions
abstract: We propose a test that takes random samples drawn from a monotone distribution
  and decides whether or not the distribution is uniform. The test is nearly optimal
  in that it uses at most O(n\sqrt\log n) samples, where n is the number of samples
  that a genie who knew all but one bit about the underlying distribution would need
  for the same task. Furthermore, we show that any such test would require Î©(n\sqrt\log
  n) samples for some distributions.
