title: Collapsed Variational Bayesian Inference for Hidden Markov Models
abstract: Approximate inference for Bayesian models is dominated by two approaches,
  variational Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Both approaches have
  their own advantages and disadvantages, and they can complement each other. Recently
  researchers have proposed collapsed variational Bayesian inference to combine the
  advantages of both. Such inference methods have been successful in several models
  whose hidden variables are conditionally independent given the parameters. In this
  paper we propose two collapsed variational Bayesian inference algorithms for hidden
  Markov models, a popular framework for representing time series data. We validate
  our algorithms on the natural language processing task of unsupervised part-of-speech
  induction, showing that they are both more computationally efficient than sampling,
  and more accurate than standard variational Bayesian inference for HMMs.
