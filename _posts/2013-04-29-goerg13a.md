title: 'Mixed LICORS: A Nonparametric Algorithm for Predictive State Reconstruction'
abstract: We introduce mixed LICORS, an algorithm for learning nonlinear, high-dimensional
  dynamics from spatio-temporal data, suitable for both prediction and simulation.
  Mixed LICORS extends the recent LICORS algorithm (Goerg and Shalizi, 2012) from
  hard clustering of predictive distributions to a non-parametric, EM-like soft clustering.
  This retains the asymptotic predictive optimality of LICORS, but, as we show in
  simulations, greatly improves out-of-sample forecasts with limited data. The new
  method is implemented in the publicly-available R package LICORS.
