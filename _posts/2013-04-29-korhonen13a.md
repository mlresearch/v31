title: Exact Learning of Bounded Tree-width Bayesian Networks
abstract: Inference in Bayesian networks is known to be NP-hard, but if the network
  has bounded tree-width, then inference becomes tractable. Not surprisingly, learning
  networks that closely match the given data and have a bounded tree-width has recently
  attracted some attention.  In this paper we aim to lay groundwork for future research
  on the topic by studying the exact complexity of this problem. We give the first
  non-trivial exact algorithm for the NP-hard problem of finding an optimal Bayesian
  network of tree-width at most w, with running time 3^n n^w + O(1), and provide an
  implementation of this algorithm. Additionally, we propose a variant of Bayesian
  network learning with “super-structures”, and show that finding a Bayesian network
  consistent with a given super-structure is fixed-parameter tractable in the tree-width
  of the super-structure.
