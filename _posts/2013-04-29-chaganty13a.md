title: Efficiently Sampling Probabilistic Programs via Program Analysis
abstract: 'Probabilistic programs are intuitive and succinct representations of complex
  probability distributions. A natural approach to performing inference over these
  programs is to execute them and compute statistics over the resulting samples. Indeed,
  this approach has been taken before in a number of probabilistic programming tools.
  In this paper, we address two key challenges of this paradigm: (i) ensuring samples
  are well distributed in the combinatorial space of the program, and (ii) efficiently
  generating samples with minimal rejection. We present a new sampling algorithm Qi
  that addresses these challenges using concepts from the field of program analysis.
  To solve the first challenge (getting diverse samples), we use a technique called
  symbolic execution to systematically explore all the paths in a program. In the
  case of programs with loops, we systematically explore all paths up to a given depth,
  and present theorems on error bounds on the estimates as a function of the path
  bounds used. To solve the second challenge (efficient samples with minimal rejection),
  we propagate observations backward through the program using the notion of Dijkstraâ€™s
  weakest preconditions and hoist these propagated conditions to condition elementary
  distributions during sampling. We present theorems explaining the mathematical properties
  of Qi, as well as empirical results from an implementation of the algorithm.'
