title: Recursive Karcher Expectation Estimators And Geometric Law of Large Numbers
abstract: This paper studies a form of law of large numbers on Pn, the space of nxn
  symmetric positive-definite matrices equipped with Fisher-Rao metric. Specifically,
  we propose a recursive algorithm for estimating the Karcher expectation of an arbitrary
  distribution defined on Pn, and we show that the estimates computed by the recursive
  algorithm asymptotically converge in probability to the correct Karcher expectation.  The
  steps in the recursive algorithm mainly consist of making appropriate moves on geodesics
  in Pn, and the algorithm is simple to implement and it offers a tremendous gain
  in computation time of several orders in magnitude over existing non-recursive algorithms.  We
  elucidate the connection between the more familiar law of large numbers for real-valued
  random variables and the asymptotic convergence of the proposed recursive algorithm,
  and our result provides an example of a new form of law of large numbers for random
  variables taking values in a Riemannian manifold.  From the practical side, the
  computation of the mean of a collection of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices
  is a fundamental ingredient in many algorithms in machine learning, computer vision
  and medical imaging applications.  We report an experiment using the proposed recursive
  algorithm for K-means clustering, demonstrating the algorithmâ€™s efficiency, accuracy
  and stability.
