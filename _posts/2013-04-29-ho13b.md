title: 'DYNACARE: Dynamic Cardiac Arrest Risk Estimation'
abstract: Cardiac arrest is a deadly condition caused by a sudden failure of the heart
  with an in-hospital mortality rate of ∼80%. Therefore, the ability to accurately
  estimate patients at high risk of cardiac arrest is crucial for improving the survival
  rate. Existing research generally fails to utilize a patient’s temporal dynamics.
  In this paper, we present two dynamic cardiac risk estimation models, focusing on
  different temporal signatures in a patient’s risk trajectory. These models can track
  a patient’s risk trajectory in real time, allow interpretability and predictability
  of a cardiac arrest event, provide an intuitive visualization to medical professionals,
  offer a personalized dynamic hazard function, and estimate the risk for a new patient.
