title: Convex Collective Matrix Factorization
abstract: In many applications, multiple interlinked sources of data are available
  and they cannot be represented by a single adjacency matrix, to which large scale
  factorization method could be applied. Collective matrix factorization is a simple
  yet powerful  approach to jointly factorize multiple matrices, each of which represents
  a relation between two entity types.  Existing algorithms to estimate parameters
  of collective matrix factorization models are based on  non-convex formulations
  of the problem; in this paper, a convex formulation of this approach is proposed.
  This enables the derivation of large scale algorithms to estimate the parameters,
  including an  iterative eigenvalue thresholding algorithm. Numerical experiments
  illustrate the benefits of this new approach.
