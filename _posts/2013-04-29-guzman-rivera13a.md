title: 'DivMCuts: Faster Training of Structural SVMs with Diverse M-Best Cutting-Planes'
abstract: Training of Structural SVMs involves solving a large Quadratic Program (QP).
  One popular method for solving this QP is a cutting-plane approach, where the most
  violated constraint is iteratively added to a working-set of constraints. Unfortunately,
  training models with a large number of parameters remains a time consuming process.
  This paper shows that significant computational savings can be achieved by adding
  multiple diverse and highly violated constraints at every iteration of the cutting-plane
  algorithm. We show that generation of such diverse cutting-planes involves extracting
  diverse M-Best solutions from the loss-augmented score of the training instances.
  To find these diverse M-Best solutions, we employ a recently proposed algorithm
  [4]. Our experiments on image segmentation and protein side-chain prediction show
  that the proposed approach can lead to significant computational savings, e.g.,
  âˆ¼28% reduction in training time.
