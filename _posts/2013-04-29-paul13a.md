title: Random Projections for Support Vector Machines
abstract: Let X be a data matrix of rank ρ, representing n points in d-dimensional
  space. The linear support vector machine constructs a hyperplane separator that
  maximizes the 1-norm soft margin. We develop a new oblivious dimension reduction
  technique which is precomputed and can be applied to any input matrix X. We prove
  that, with high probability, the margin and minimum enclosing ball in the feature
  space are preserved to within ε-relative error, ensuring comparable generalization
  as in the original space. We present extensive experiments with real and synthetic
  data to support our theory.
