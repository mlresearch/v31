title: Bethe Bounds and Approximating the Global Optimum
abstract: 'Inference in general Markov random fields (MRFs) is NP-hard, though identifying
  the maximum a posteriori (MAP) configuration of pairwise MRFs with submodular cost
  functions is efficiently solvable using graph cuts. Marginal inference, however,
  even for this restricted class, is #P-hard. Restricting to binary pairwise models,
  we prove new formulations of derivatives of the Bethe free energy, provide bounds
  on the derivatives and bracket the locations of stationary points. Several results
  apply whether the model is associative or not. Applying these to discretized pseudo-marginals
  in the associative case, we present a polynomial time approximation scheme for global
  optimization  of the Bethe free energy provided the maximum degree ∆=O(\log n),
  where n is the number of variables. Runtime is guaranteed O(ε^-3/2 n^6 Σ^3/4 Ω^3/2),
  where Σ=O(∆/n) is the fraction of possible edges present and Ωis a function of MRF
  parameters. We examine use of the algorithm in practice, demonstrating runtime that
  is typically much faster, and discuss several extensions.'
