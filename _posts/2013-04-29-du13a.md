title: Uncover Topic-Sensitive Information Diffusion Networks
abstract: Analyzing the spreading patterns of memes with respect to their topic distributions
  and the underlying diffusion network structures is an important task in social network
  analysis. This task in many cases becomes very challenging since the underlying
  diffusion networks are often hidden, and the topic specific transmission rates are
  unknown either. In this paper, we propose a continuous time model, TopicCascade,
  for topic-sensitive information diffusion networks, and infer the hidden diffusion
  networks and the topic dependent transmission rates from the observed time stamps
  and contents of cascades. One attractive property of the model is that its parameters
  can be estimated via a convex optimization which we solve with an efficient proximal
  gradient based block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm. In both synthetic and real-world
  data, we show that our method significantly improves over the previous state-of-the-art
  models in terms of both recovering the hidden diffusion networks and predicting
  the transmission times of memes.
