title: 'Estimating the Partition Function of Graphical Models  Using Langevin Importance
  Sampling  '
abstract: Graphical models are powerful in modeling a variety of applications. Computing
  the partition function of a graphical model is a typical inference problem and known
  as an NP-hard problem for general graphs. A few sampling algorithms like MCMC, Simulated
  Annealing Sampling (SAS), Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) are developed to address
  this challenging problem. This paper describes a Langevin Importance Sampling (LIS)
  algorithm to compute the partition function of a graphical model. LIS first performs
  a random walk in the configuration-temperature space guided by the Langevin equation
  and then estimates the partition function using all the samples generated during
  the random walk, as opposed to the other configuration-temperature sampling methods,
  which uses only the samples at a specific temperature. Experimental results show
  that LIS can obtain much more accurate partition function than the others tested
  on several different types of graphical models. LIS performs especially well on
  relatively large graph models or those with a large number of local optima.
