title: 'Beyond Sentiment: The Manifold of Human Emotions'
abstract: Sentiment analysis predicts the presence of positive or negative emotions
  in a text document. In this paper we consider higher dimensional extensions of the
  sentiment concept, which represent a richer set of human emotions. Our approach
  goes beyond previous work in that our model contains a continuous manifold rather
  than a finite set of human emotions. We investigate the resulting model, compare
  it to psychological observations, and explore its predictive capabilities. Besides
  obtaining significant improvements over a baseline without manifold, we are also
  able to visualize different notions of positive sentiment in different domains.
