title: Distributed and Adaptive Darting Monte Carlo through Regenerations
abstract: 'Darting Monte Carlo (DMC) is a MCMC procedure designed to effectively mix
  between multiple modes of a probability distribution. We propose an adaptive and
  distributed version of this method by using regenerations. This allows us to run
  multiple chains in parallel and adapt the shape of the jump regions as well as all
  other aspects of the Markov chain on the fly. We show that this significantly improves
  the performance of DMC because 1) a population of chains has a higher chance of
  finding the modes in the distribution, 2) jumping between modes becomes easier due
  to the adaptation of their shapes, 3) computation is much more efficient due to
  parallelization across multiple processors. While the curse of dimensionality is
  a challenge for both DMC and regeneration, we find that their combination ameliorates
  this issue slightly. '
