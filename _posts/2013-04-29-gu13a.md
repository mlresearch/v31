title: Unsupervised Link Selection in Networks
abstract: 'Real-world networks are often noisy, and the existing linkage structure
  may not be reliable. For example, a link which connects nodes from different communities
  may affect the group assignment of  nodes in a negative way. In this paper, we study
  a new problem called link selection, which can be seen as the network equivalent
  of the traditional feature selection problem in machine learning. More specifically,
  we investigate unsupervised link selection as follows: given a network, it selects
  a subset of informative links from the original network which enhance the quality
  of community structures. To achieve this goal, we use Ratio Cut size of a network
  as the quality measure. The resulting link selection approach can be formulated
  as a semi-definite programming problem. In order to solve it efficiently, we propose
  a backward elimination algorithm using sequential optimization. Experiments on benchmark
  network datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our method.'
