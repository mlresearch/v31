title: Active Learning for Interactive Visualization
abstract: Many automatic visualization methods have been proposed. However, a visualization
  that is automatically generated might be different to how a user wants to arrange
  the objects in visualization space. By allowing users to re-locate objects in the
  embedding space of the visualization, they can adjust the visualization to their
  preference. We propose an active learning framework for interactive visualization
  which selects objects for the user to re-locate so that they can obtain their desired
  visualization by re-locating as few as possible. The framework is based on an information
  theoretic criterion, which favors objects that reduce the uncertainty of the visualization.
  We present a concrete application of the proposed framework to the Laplacian eigenmap
  visualization method. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed framework
  yields the desired visualization with fewer user interactions than existing methods.
