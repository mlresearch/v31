title: Stochastic blockmodeling of relational event dynamics
abstract: 'Several approaches have recently been proposed for modeling of continuous-time
  network data via dyadic event rates conditioned on the observed history of events
  and nodal or dyadic covariates. In many cases, however, interaction propensities
  – and even the underlying mechanisms of interaction – vary systematically across
  subgroups whose identities are unobserved. For static networks such heterogeneity
  has been treated via methods such as stochastic blockmodeling, which operate by
  assuming latent groups of individuals with similar tendencies in their group-wise
  interactions. Here we combine ideas from stochastic blockmodeling and continuous-time
  network models by positing a latent partition of the node set such that event dynamics
  within and between subsets evolve in potentially distinct ways. We illustrate the
  use of our model family by application to several forms of dyadic interaction data,
  including email communication and Twitter direct messages. Parameter estimates from
  the fitted models clearly reveal heterogeneity in the dynamics among groups of individuals.
  We also find that the fitted models have better predictive accuracy than both baseline
  models and relational event models that lack latent structure. '
