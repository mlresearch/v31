title: Bayesian Structure Learning for Functional Neuroimaging
abstract: Predictive modeling of functional neuroimaging data has become an important
  tool for analyzing cognitive structures in the brain.  Brain images are high-dimensional
  and exhibit large correlations, and imaging experiments provide a limited number
  of samples. Therefore, capturing the inherent statistical properties of the imaging
  data is critical for robust inference. Previous methods tackle this problem by exploiting
  either spatial sparsity or smoothness, which does not fully exploit the  structure
  in the data. Here we develop a flexible, hierarchical model designed to simultaneously
  capture spatial block sparsity and smoothness in neuroimaging data. We exploit a
  function domain representation for the high-dimensional small-sample data and develop
  efficient inference, parameter estimation, and prediction procedures. Empirical
  results with simulated and real neuroimaging data suggest that simultaneously capturing
  the block sparsity and smoothness properties can significantly improve structure
  recovery and predictive modeling performance.
