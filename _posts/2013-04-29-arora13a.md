title: Consensus Ranking with Signed Permutations
abstract: Signed permutations (also known as the hyperoctahedral group) are used in
  modeling genome rearrangements. The algorithmic problems they raise are computationally
  demanding when not NP-hard.  This paper presents a tractable algorithm for learning
  consensus ranking between signed permutations under the inversion distance.  This
  can be extended to estimate a natural class of exponential models over the group
  of signed permutations. We investigate experimentally the efficiency of our algorithm
  for modeling data generated by random reversals.
