title: Supervised Sequential Classification Under Budget Constraints
abstract: In this paper we develop a framework for a sequential decision making under
  budget constraints for multi-class classification. In many classification systems,
  such as medical diagnosis and homeland security, sequential decisions are often
  warranted. For each instance, a sensor is first chosen for acquiring measurements
  and then based on the available information one decides (rejects) to seek more measurements
  from a new sensor/modality or to terminate by classifying the example based on the
  available information. Different sensors have varying costs for acquisition, and
  these costs account for delay, throughput or monetary value. Consequently, we seek
  methods for maximizing performance of the system subject to budget constraints.  We
  formulate a multi-stage multi-class empirical risk objective and learn sequential
  decision functions from training data. We show that reject decision at each stage
  can be posed as supervised binary classification. We derive bounds for the VC dimension
  of the multi-stage system to quantify the generalization error. We compare our approach
  to alternative strategies on several multi-class real world datasets.
