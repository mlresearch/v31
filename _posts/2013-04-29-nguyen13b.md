title: Efficient Variational Inference for Gaussian Process Regression Networks
abstract: 'In multi-output regression applications the correlations between the response
  variables may vary with the input space and can be highly non-linear.  Gaussian
  process regression networks (GPRNs)  are flexible  and effective models to represent
  such complex adaptive output dependencies. However, inference in GPRNs is  intractable.  In
  this paper we propose two efficient variational inference methods for  GPRNs. The
  first method, GPRN-MF, adopts a mean-field approach with full Gaussians over the
  GPRN’s parameters as its factorizing distributions. The second method, GPRN-NPV,
  uses a nonparametric  variational inference approach. We derive analytical forms
  for the evidence lower bound on both methods, which we use to learn the variational
  parameters and the hyper-parameters of the GPRN model. We obtain closed-form updates
  for the parameters of  GPRN-MF  and show that, while having relatively complex approximate
  posterior distributions, our approximate methods require the estimation of  O(N)
  variational parameters rather than O(N2) for the  parameters’ covariances.  Our
  experiments on real data sets show that GPRN-NPV  may give a better approximation
  to the posterior distribution compared to GPRN-MF,  in terms of both predictive
  performance and stability. '
