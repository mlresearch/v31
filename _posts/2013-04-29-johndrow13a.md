title: Diagonal Orthant Multinomial Probit Models
section: notable
note: Notable paper award
abstract: 'Bayesian classification commonly relies on probit models, with data augmentation
  algorithms used for posterior computation.  By imputing latent Gaussian variables,
  one can often trivially adapt computational approaches used in Gaussian models.
  However, MCMC for multinomial probit (MNP) models can be inefficient in practice
  due to high posterior dependence between latent variables and parameters, and to
  difficulties in efficiently sampling latent variables when there are more than two
  categories.  To address these problems, we propose a new class of diagonal orthant
  (DO) multinomial models.  The key characteristics of these models include conditional
  independence of the latent variables given model parameters, avoidance of arbitrary
  identifiability restrictions, and simple expressions for category probabilities.
  We show substantially improved computational efficiency and comparable predictive
  performance to MNP. '
