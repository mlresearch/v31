title: 'Predictive Correlation Screening: Application to Two-stage Predictor Design
  in High Dimension'
abstract: We introduce a new approach to variable selection, called Predictive Correlation
  Screening, for predictor design. Predictive Correlation Screening (PCS) implements
  false positive control on the selected variables, is well suited to small sample
  sizes, and is scalable to high dimensions. We establish asymptotic bounds for Familywise
  Error Rate (FWER), and resultant mean square error of a linear predictor on the
  selected variables. We apply Predictive Correlation Screening to the following two-stage
  predictor design problem. An experimenter wants to learn a multivariate predictor
  of gene expressions based on successive biological samples assayed on mRNA arrays.
  She assays the whole genome on a few samples and from these assays she selects a
  small number of variables using Predictive Correlation Screening. To reduce assay
  cost, she subsequently assays only the selected variables on the remaining samples,
  to learn the predictor coefficients. We show superiority of Predictive Correlation
  Screening relative to LASSO and correlation learning (sometimes popularly referred
  to in the literature as marginal regression or simple thresholding) in terms of
  performance and computational complexity.
