title: 'Computing the M Most Probable Modes of a Graphical Model '
abstract: 'We introduce the M-modes problem for graphical models:  predicting the
  M label configurations of highest probability  that are at the same time local maxima
  of the probability  landscape. M-modes have multiple possible applications:  because
  they are intrinsically diverse, they provide a  principled alternative to non-maximum
  suppression techniques  for structured prediction, they can act as codebook vectors  for
  quantizing the configuration space, or they can form  component centers for mixture
  model approximation.  We present two algorithms for solving the M-modes problem.
  The first algorithm solves the problem in polynomial time  when the underlying graphical
  model is a simple chain. The second algorithm solves the problem for junction chains.   In
  synthetic and real dataset, we demonstrate how M-modes  can improve the performance
  of prediction. We also use the  generated modes as a tool to understand the topography  of
  the probability distribution of configurations, for example with relation to the
  training set size and  amount of noise in the data.'
