title: Block Regularized Lasso for Multivariate Multi-Response Linear Regression
abstract: The multivariate multi-response (MVMR) linear regression problem is investigated,
  in which design matrices can be distributed differently across K linear regressions.
  The support union of K p-dimensional regression vectors are recovered via block
  regularized Lasso which uses the l_1/l_2 norm for regression vectors across K tasks.
  Sufficient and necessary conditions to guarantee successful recovery of the support
  union are characterized. More specifically, it is shown that under certain conditions
  on the distributions of design matrices, if n > c_p1 ψ(B^*,Σ^(1:K))\log(p-s) where
  c_p1 is a constant and s is the size of the support set, then the l_1/l_2 regularized
  Lasso correctly recovers the support union; and if n < c_p2 ψ(B^*,Σ^(1:K))\log(p-s)
  where c_p2 is a constant, then the l_1/l_2 regularized Lasso fails to recover the
  support union. In particular, ψ(B^*,Σ^(1:K)) captures the sparsity of K regression
  vectors and the statistical properties of the design matrices. Numerical results
  are provided to demonstrate the advantages of joint support union recovery using
  multi-task Lasso problem over studying each problem individually.
