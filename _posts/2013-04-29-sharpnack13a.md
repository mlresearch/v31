title: Detecting Activations over Graphs using Spanning Tree Wavelet Bases
abstract: We consider the detection of clusters of activation over graphs under Gaussian
  noise.  This problem appears in many real world scenarios, such as the detecting
  contamination or seismic activity by sensor networks, viruses in human and computer
  networks, and groups with anomalous behavior in social and biological networks.  Despite
  the wide applicability of such a detection algorithm, there has been little success
  in the development of computationally feasible methods with provable theoretical
  guarantees.  To this end, we introduce the spanning tree wavelet basis over a graph,
  a localized basis that reflects the topology of the graph.  We first provide a necessary
  condition for asymptotic distinguishability of the null and alternative hypotheses.  Then
  we prove that for any spanning tree, we can hope to correctly detect signals in
  a low signal-to-noise regime using spanning tree wavelets.  We propose a randomized
  test, in which we use a uniform spanning tree in the basis construction.  Using
  electrical network theory, we show that the uniform spanning tree provides strong
  guarantees that in many cases match our necessary condition.  We prove that for
  edge transitive graphs, k-nearest neighbor graphs, and Îµ-graphs we obtain nearly
  optimal performance with the uniform spanning tree wavelet detector.
