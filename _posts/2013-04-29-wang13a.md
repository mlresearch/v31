title: Sparse Principal Component Analysis for High Dimensional Multivariate Time
  Series
section: notable
note: Notable paper award
abstract: We study sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA) for high dimensional
  multivariate vector autoregressive (VAR) time series. By treating the transition
  matrix as a nuisance parameter, we show that sparse PCA can be directly applied
  on analyzing multivariate time series  as if the data are i.i.d. generated.   Under
  a double asymptotic framework in which both the length of the sample period T and
  dimensionality d of the time series can increase (with possibly dâ‰«T), we provide
  explicit rates of convergence of the angle between the estimated and population
  leading eigenvectors of the time series covariance matrix. Our results suggest that
  the spectral norm of the transition matrix  plays a pivotal role in determining
  the final rates of convergence. Implications of such a general result is further
  illustrated using concrete examples.  The results of this paper have impacts on
  different applications, including financial time series,  biomedical imaging, and
  social media, etc.
