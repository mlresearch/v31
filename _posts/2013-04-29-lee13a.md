title: Structure Learning of Mixed Graphical Models
abstract: We consider the problem of learning the structure of a pairwise graphical
  model over continuous and discrete variables. We present a new pairwise model for
  graphical models with both continuous and discrete variables that is amenable to
  structure learning. In previous work, authors have considered structure learning
  of Gaussian graphical models and structure learning of discrete models. Our approach
  is a natural generalization of these two lines of work to the mixed case. The penalization
  scheme is new and follows naturally from a particular parametrization of the model.
