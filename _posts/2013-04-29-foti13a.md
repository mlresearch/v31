title: A unifying representation for a class of dependent random measures
section: notable
note: Notable paper award
abstract: We present a general construction for dependent random measures based on
  thinning Poisson processes on an augmented space. The framework is not restricted
  to dependent versions of a specific nonparametric model, but can be applied to all
  models that can be represented using completely random measures. Several existing
  dependent random measures can be seen as specific cases of this framework. Interesting
  properties of the resulting measures are derived and the efficacy of the framework
  is demonstrated by constructing a covariate-dependent latent  feature model and
  topic model that obtain superior predictive performance.
