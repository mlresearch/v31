title: Learning Social Infectivity in Sparse Low-rank Networks Using Multi-dimensional
  Hawkes Processes
abstract: How will the behaviors of individuals in a social network be influenced
  by their neighbors, the authorities and the communities? Such knowledge is often
  hidden from us and we only observe its manifestation in the form of recurrent and
  time-stamped events occurring at the individuals involved. It is an important yet
  challenging problem to infer the network of social inference based on the temporal
  patterns of these historical events.   We propose a convex optimization approach
  to discover the hidden network of social influence by modeling the recurrent events
  at different individuals as multi-dimensional Hawkes processes. Furthermore, our
  estimation procedure, using nuclear and \ell_1 norm regularization simultaneously
  on the parameters, is able to take into account the prior knowledge of the presence
  of neighbor interaction, authority influence, and community coordination. To efficiently
  solve the problem, we also design an algorithm ADM4 which combines techniques of
  alternating direction method of multipliers and majorization minimization. We experimented
  with both synthetic and real world data sets, and showed that the proposed method
  can discover the hidden network more accurately and produce a better predictive
  model.
