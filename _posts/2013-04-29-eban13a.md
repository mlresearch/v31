title: Dynamic Copula Networks for Modeling Real-valued Time Series
abstract: Probabilistic modeling of temporal phenomena is of central importance in
  a variety of fields ranging from neuroscience to economics to speech recognition.
  While the task has received extensive attention in recent decades, learning temporal
  models for multivariate real-valued data that is non-Gaussian is still a formidable
  challenge. Recently, the power of copulas, a framework for representing complex
  multi-modal and heavy-tailed distributions, was fused with the formalism of Bayesian
  networks to allow for flexible modeling of high-dimensional distributions. In this
  work we introduce Dynamic Copula Bayesian Networks, a generalization aimed at capturing
  the distribution of rich temporal sequences. We apply our model to three markedly
  different real-life domains and demonstrate substantial quantitative and qualitative
  advantage.
