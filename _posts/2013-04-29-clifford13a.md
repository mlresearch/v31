title: A simple sketching algorithm for entropy estimation over streaming data
abstract: 'We consider the problem of approximating the empirical Shannon entropy
  of a high-frequency data stream under the relaxed strict-turnstile model, when space
  limitations make exact computation infeasible. An equivalent measure of entropy
  is the Renyi entropy that depends on a constant α.  This quantity can be estimated
  efficiently and unbiasedly from a low-dimensional synopsis called an α-stable data
  sketch via the method of compressed counting.  An approximation to the Shannon entropy
  can be obtained from the Renyi entropy by taking alpha sufficiently close to 1.
  However, practical guidelines for parameter calibration with respect to αare lacking.
  We avoid this problem by showing that the random variables used in estimating the
  Renyi entropy can be transformed to have a proper distributional limit as αapproaches
  1: the maximally skewed, strictly stable distribution with α= 1 defined on the entire
  real line.  We propose a family of asymptotically unbiased log-mean estimators of
  the Shannon entropy, indexed by a constant ζ> 0, that can be computed in a single-pass
  algorithm to provide an additive approximation. We recommend the log-mean estimator
  with ζ= 1 that has exponentially decreasing tail bounds on the error probability,
  asymptotic relative efficiency of 0.932, and near-optimal computational complexity.  '
