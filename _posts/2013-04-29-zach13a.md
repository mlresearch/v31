title: Dual Decomposition for Joint Discrete-Continuous Optimization
abstract: 'We analyse convex formulations for combined discrete-continuous MAP inference
  using the dual decomposition method. As a consquence we can provide a more intuitive
  derivation for the resulting convex relaxation than presented in the literature.
  Further, we show how to strengthen the relaxation by reparametrizing the potentials,
  hence convex relaxations for discrete-continuous inference does not share an important
  feature of LP relaxations for discrete labeling problems: incorporating unary potentials
  into higher order ones affects the quality of the relaxation. We argue that the
  convex model for discrete-continuous inference is very general and can be used as
  alternative for alternation-based methods often employed for such joint inference
  tasks. '
