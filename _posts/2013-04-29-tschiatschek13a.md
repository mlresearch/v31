title: On the Asymptotic Optimality of Maximum Margin Bayesian Networks
abstract: Maximum margin Bayesian networks (MMBNs) are Bayesian networks with discriminatively
  optimized parameters. They have shown good classification performance in various
  applications. However, there has not been any theoretic analysis of their asymptotic
  performance, e.g. their Bayes consistency. For specific classes of MMBNs, i.e. MMBNs
  with fully connected graphs and discrete-valued nodes, we show Bayes consistency
  for binary-class problems and a sufficient condition for Bayes consistency in the
  multi-class case. We provide simple examples showing that MMBNs in their current
  formulation are not Bayes consistent in general. These examples are especially interesting,
  as the model used for the MMBNs can represent the assumed true distributions. This
  indicates that the current formulations of MMBNs may be deficient. Furthermore,
  experimental results on the generalization performance are presented.
