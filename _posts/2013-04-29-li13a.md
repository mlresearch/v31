title: Dynamic Scaled Sampling for Deterministic Constraints
abstract: 'Deterministic and near-deterministic relationships among subsets of random
  variables in multivariate systems are known to cause serious problems for Monte
  Carlo algorithms. We examine the case in which the relationship Z = f(X_1,...,X_k)
  holds, where each X_i has a continuous prior pdf and we wish to obtain samples from
  the conditional distribution P(X_1,...,X_k | Z= s). When f is addition, the problem
  is NP-hard even when the X_i are independent. In more restricted cases — for example,
  i.i.d. Boolean or categorical X_i — efficient exact samplers have been obtained
  previously. For the general continuous case, we propose a dynamic scaling algorithm
  (DYSC), and prove that it has O(k) expected running time and finite variance.  We
  discuss generalizations of DYSC to functions f described by binary operation trees.
  We evaluate the algorithm on several examples. '
