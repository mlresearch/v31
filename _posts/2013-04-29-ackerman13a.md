title: Clustering Oligarchies
abstract: We investigate the extent to which clustering algorithms are robust to the
  addition of a small, potentially adversarial, set of points. Our analysis reveals
  radical differences in the robustness of  popular clustering methods. k-means and
  several related techniques are robust when data is clusterable, and we provide a
  quantitative analysis capturing the precise relationship between clusterability
  and robustness. In contrast, common linkage-based algorithms and several standard
  objective-function-based clustering methods can be highly sensitive to the addition
  of a small set of points even when the data is highly clusterable. We call such
  sets of points oligarchies. Lastly, we show that the behavior with respect to oligarchies
  of the popular Lloydâ€™s method changes radically with the initialization technique.
