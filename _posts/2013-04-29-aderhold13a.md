title: Reconstructing ecological networks with hierarchical Bayesian regression and
  Mondrian processes
abstract: Ecological systems consist of complex sets of interactions among species
  and their environment, the understanding of which has implications for predicting
  environmental response to perturbations such as invading species and climate change.  However,
  the revelation of these interactions is not straightforward, nor are the interactions
  necessarily stable across space. Machine learning can enable the recovery of such
  complex, spatially varying interactions from relatively easily obtained species
  abundance data. Here, we describe a novel Bayesian regression and Mondrian process
  model (BRAMP) for reconstructing species interaction networks from observed field
  data. BRAMP enables robust inference of species interactions considering autocorrelation
  in species abundances and allowing for variation in the interactions across space.
  We evaluate the model on spatially explicit simulated data, produced using a trophic
  niche model combined with stochastic population dynamics. We compare the modelâ€™s
  performance against L1-penalized sparse regression (LASSO) and non-linear Bayesian
  networks with the BDe scoring scheme. Finally, we apply BRAMP to real ecological
  data.
