title: Why Steiner-tree type algorithms work for community detection
abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a specific connected community
  S ⊂V in a graph G = (V, E), where each node v is associated with a signal whose
  strength grows with the likelihood that v belongs to S. This problem appears in
  social or protein interaction network, the latter also referred to as the signaling
  pathway reconstruction problem.  We study this community reconstruction problem
  under several natural generative models, and make the following two contributions.
  First, in the context of social networks, where the signals are modeled as bounded-supported
  random variables, we design an efficient algorithm for recovering most members in
  S with well-controlled false positive overhead, by utilizing the network structure
  for a large family of “homogeneous” generative models. This positive result is complemented
  by an information theoretic lower bound for the case where the network structure
  is unknown or the network is heterogeneous. Second, we consider the case in which
  the graph represents the protein interaction network, in which it is customary to
  consider signals that have unbounded support, we generalize our first contribution
  to give the first theoretical justification of why existing Steiner-tree type heuristics
  work well in practice.
