title: A recursive estimate for the predictive likelihood in a topic model
abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating the predictive log likelihood of a
  previously un- seen document under a topic model. This task arises when cross-validating
  for a model hyperparameter, when testing a model on a hold-out set, and when comparing
  the performance of different fitting strategies. Yet it is known to be very challenging,
  as it is equivalent to estimating a marginal likelihood in Bayesian model selection.
  We propose a fast algorithm for approximating this likelihood, one whose computational
  cost is linear both in document length and in the number of topics. The method is
  a first-order approximation to the algorithm of Carvalho et al. (2010), and can
  also be interpreted as a one-particle, Rao-Blackwellized version of the "left-to-right"
  method of Wallach et al. (2009). On our test examples, the proposed method gives
  similar answers to these other methods, but at lower computational cost.
