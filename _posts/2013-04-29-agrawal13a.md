title: Further Optimal Regret Bounds for Thompson Sampling
abstract: Thompson Sampling is one of the oldest heuristics for multi-armed bandit
  problems. It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently
  generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have comparable
  or better empirical performance compared to the state of the art methods. In this
  paper, we provide a novel regret analysis for Thompson Sampling that proves the
  first near-optimal problem-independent  bound of O(\sqrtNT\ln T) on the expected
  regret of this algorithm. Our novel martingale-based analysis techniques are conceptually
  simple, and easily extend to distributions other than the Beta distribution. For
  the version of Thompson Sampling that uses Gaussian priors, we prove a problem-independent
  bound of O(\sqrtNT\ln N) on the expected regret, and demonstrate the optimality
  of this bound by providing a matching lower bound. This lower bound of Ω(\sqrtNT\ln
  N) is the first lower bound on the performance of a natural version of Thompson
  Sampling that is away from the general lower bound of O(\sqrtNT) for the multi-armed
  bandit problem. Our near-optimal problem-independent bounds for Thompson Sampling
  solve a COLT 2012 open problem of Chapelle and Li. Additionally, our techniques
  simultaneously provide the optimal problem-dependent bound of (1+ε)\sum_i \frac\ln
  Td(\mu_i, \mu_1)+O(\fracNε^2) on the expected regret.  The optimal problem-dependent
  regret bound for this problem was first proven recently by Kaufmann et al. [2012].
