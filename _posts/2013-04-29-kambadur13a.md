title: A Parallel, Block Greedy Method for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation for
  Ultra-high Dimensions
abstract: Discovering the graph structure of a Gaussian Markov Random Field is an
  important problem in application areas such as computational biology and atmospheric
  sciences. This task, which translates to estimating the sparsity pattern of the
  inverse covariance matrix, has been extensively studied in the literature. However,
  the existing approaches are unable to handle ultra-high dimensional datasets and
  there is a crucial need to develop methods that are both highly scalable and memory-efficient.
  In this paper, we present GINCO, a blocked greedy method for sparse inverse covariance
  matrix estimation. We also present detailed description of a highly-scalable and
  memory-efficient implementation of GINCO, which is able to operate on both shared-
  and distributed-memory architectures. Our implementation is able recover the sparsity
  pattern of 25,000 vertex random and chain graphs with 87% and 84% accuracy in \le
  5 minutes using \le 10GB of memory on a single 8-core machine. Furthermore, our
  method is statistically consistent in recovering the sparsity pattern of the inverse
  covariance matrix, which we demonstrate through extensive empirical studies.
