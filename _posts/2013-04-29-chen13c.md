title: Evidence Estimation for Bayesian Partially Observed MRFs
abstract: Bayesian estimation in Markov random fields is very hard due to the intractability
  of the partition function. The introduction of hidden units makes the situation
  even worse due to the presence of potentially very many modes in the posterior distribution.
  For the first time we propose a comprehensive procedure to address one of the Bayesian
  estimation problems, approximating the evidence of partially observed MRFs based
  on the Laplace approximation. We also introduce a number of approximate MCMC-based
  methods for comparison but find that the Laplace approximation significantly outperforms
  these.
