title: 'Structural Expectation Propagation (SEP): Bayesian structure learning for
  networks with latent variables'
abstract: 'Learning the structure of discrete Bayesian networks has been the subject
  of extensive research in machine learning, with most Bayesian approaches focusing
  on fully observed networks. One of few the methods that can handle networks with
  latent variables is the "structural EM algorithm" which interleaves greedy structure
  search with the estimation of latent variables and parameters, maintaining a single
  best network at each step. We introduce Structural Expectation Propagation (SEP),
  an extension of EP which can infer the structure of Bayesian networks having latent
  variables and missing data. SEP performs variational inference in a joint model
  of structure, latent variables, and parameters, offering two advantages: (i) it
  accounts for uncertainty in structure and parameter values when making local distribution
  updates (ii) it returns a variational distribution over network structures rather
  than a single network. We demonstrate the performance of SEP  both on synthetic
  problems and on real-world clinical data. '
