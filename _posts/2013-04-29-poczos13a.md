title: Distribution-Free Distribution Regression
abstract: Distribution regression refers to the situation where a response Y depends
  on a covariate P where P is a probability distribution. The model is Y=f(P) + e
  where f is an unknown regression function and e is a random error. Typically, we
  do not observe P directly, but rather, we observe a sample from P. In this paper
  we develop theory and methods for distribution-free versions of distribution regression.
  This means that we do not make strong distributional assumptions about the error
  term e and covariate P. We prove that when the effective dimension is small enough
  (as measured by the doubling dimension), then the excess prediction risk converges
  to zero with a polynomial rate.
