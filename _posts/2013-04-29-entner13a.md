title: Data-driven covariate selection for nonparametric estimation of causal effects
abstract: The estimation of causal effects from non-experimental data is a fundamental
  problem in many fields of science. One of the main obstacles concerns confounding
  by observed or latent covariates, an issue which is typically tackled by adjusting
  for some set of observed covariates. In this contribution, we analyze the problem
  of inferring whether a given variable has a causal effect on another and, if it
  does, inferring an adjustment set of covariates that yields a consistent and unbiased
  estimator of this effect, based on the (conditional) independence and dependence
  relationships among the observed variables. We provide two elementary rules that
  we show to be both sound and complete for this task, and compare the performance
  of a straightforward application of these rules with standard alternative procedures
  for selecting adjustment sets.
