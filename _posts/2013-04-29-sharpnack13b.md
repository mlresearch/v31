title: Changepoint Detection over Graphs with the Spectral Scan Statistic
abstract: We consider the change-point detection problem of deciding, based on noisy
  measurements, whether an unknown signal over a given graph is constant or is instead
  piecewise constant over two induced subgraphs of relatively low cut size. We analyze
  the corresponding generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistic and relate it to
  the problem of finding a sparsest cut in a graph. We develop a tractable relaxation
  of the  GLR statistic based on the combinatorial Laplacian of the graph, which we
  call the spectral scan statistic,  and analyze its properties. We show how its performance
  as a testing procedure depends directly on the spectrum of the graph, and use this  result
  to explicitly derive its asymptotic properties on few graph topologies. Finally,
  we demonstrate both theoretically and by simulations that the spectral scan statistic
  can outperform naive testing procedures based on edge thresholding and Ï‡^2 testing.
