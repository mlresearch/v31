title: A simple criterion for controlling selection bias
abstract: Controlling selection bias, a statistical error caused by preferential sampling
  of data, is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistical inference.
  This paper presents a simple criterion for controlling selection bias in the odds
  ratio, a widely used measure for association between variables, that connects the
  nature of selection bias with the graph modeling the selection mechanism. If the
  graph contains certain paths, we show that the odds ratio cannot be expressed using
  data with selection bias. Otherwise, we show that a d-separability test can determine
  whether the odds ratio can be recovered, and when the answer is affirmative, output
  an unbiased estimand of the odds ratio. The criterion can be test in linear time
  and enhances the power of the estimand.
