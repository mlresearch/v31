title: Central Limit Theorems for Conditional Markov Chains
abstract: This paper studies Central Limit Theorems for real-valued functionals of
  Conditional Markov Chains. Using a classical result by Dobrushin (1956) for non-stationary
  Markov chains,  a conditional Central Limit Theorem for fixed sequences of observations
  is established. The asymptotic variance can be estimated by resampling the latent
  states conditional on the observations. If the conditional means themselves are
  asymptotically normally distributed, an unconditional Central Limit Theorem can
  be obtained. The methodology is used to construct a statistical hypothesis test
  which is applied to synthetically generated environmental data.
