title: Distributed Learning of Gaussian Graphical Models via Marginal Likelihoods
section: notable
note: Notable paper award
abstract: We consider distributed estimation of the inverse covariance matrix, also
  called the concentration matrix, in Gaussian graphical models. Traditional centralized
  estimation often requires iterative and expensive global inference and is therefore
  difficult in large distributed networks. In this paper, we propose a general framework
  for distributed estimation based on a maximum marginal likelihood (MML) approach.
  Each node independently computes a local estimate by maximizing a marginal likelihood
  defined with respect to data collected from its local neighborhood. Due to the non-convexity
  of the MML problem, we derive and consider solving a convex relaxation.  The local
  estimates are then combined into a global estimate without the need for iterative
  message-passing between neighborhoods.  We prove that this relaxed MML estimator
  is asymptotically consistent. Through numerical experiments on several synthetic
  and real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the two-hop version of the proposed
  estimator is significantly better than the one-hop version, and nearly closes the
  gap to the centralized maximum likelihood estimator in many situations.
