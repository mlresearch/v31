title: Texture Modeling with Convolutional Spike-and-Slab RBMs and Deep Extensions
abstract: We apply the spike-and-slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ssRBM) to texture
  modeling. The ssRBM with tiled-convolution weight sharing (TssRBM) achieves or surpasses
  the state-of-the-art on texture synthesis and inpainting by parametric models. We
  also develop a novel RBM model with a spike-and-slab visible layer and binary variables
  in the hidden layer. This model is designed to be stacked on top of the ssRBM. We
  show the resulting deep belief network (DBN) is a powerful generative model that
  improves on single-layer models and is capable of modeling not only single high-resolution
  and challenging textures but also multiple textures with fixed-size filters in the
  bottom layer.
