title: Learning to Top-K Search using Pairwise Comparisons
abstract: Given a collection of N items with some unknown underlying ranking, we examine
  how to use pairwise comparisons to determine the top ranked items in the set.  Resolving
  the top items from pairwise comparisons has application in diverse fields ranging
  from recommender systems to image-based search to protein structure analysis.  In
  this paper we introduce techniques to resolve the top ranked items using significantly
  fewer than all the possible pairwise comparisons using both random and adaptive
  sampling methodologies.  Using randomly-chosen comparisons, a graph-based technique
  is shown to efficiently resolve the top O(\logN) items when there are no comparison
  errors.  In terms of adaptively-chosen comparisons, we show how the top O(\logN)
  items can be found, even in the presence of corrupted observations, using a voting
  methodology that only requires O(N\log^2N) pairwise comparisons.
