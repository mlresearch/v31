title: Statistical Tests for Contagion in Observational Social Network Studies
abstract: Current tests for contagion in social network studies are vulnerable to
  the confounding effects of latent homophily (i.e., ties form preferentially between
  individuals with similar hidden traits). We demonstrate a general method to lower
  bound the strength of causal effects in observational social network studies, even
  in the presence of arbitrary, unobserved individual traits. Our tests require no
  parametric assumptions and each test is associated with an algebraic proof. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach by correctly deducing the causal effects for examples
  previously shown to expose defects in existing methodology. Finally, we discuss
  preliminary results on data taken from the Framingham Heart Study.
